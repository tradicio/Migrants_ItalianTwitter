The present repository contains a dataset consisting of about 5 million of tweets on the issued of migration discussed on the Italian Twittersphere. The dataset present here can be used **only** if the following terms are accepted:

- This dataset is available for research purposes only;
- The papers indicated here in the *References* Section are going to be cited in any research product whose findings are based on this dataset.

## Data Extraction

Data are extracted via the Twitter Streaming API over the period from April 24, 2019 to November 24, 2019, requiring that each tweet contains at least one of the following keywords: _accoglienza_ (hospitality), _apriteiporti_ (open the ports), _chiudiamoiporti_ (close the ports), _immigrazione_ (immigration), _integrazione_ (integration), _migranti_ (migrants), _restiamoumani_ (letâ€™s stay human), _rifugiati_ (refugees), _sbarchi_ (landings), _stopinvasione_ (stop the invasion). 

**Only** the list of tweet IDs is available. The IDs can be then hydrated with software programs specifically designed for retrieving tweet information starting from the tweet ID. An example is the Github repository called [Hydrator](https://github.com/DocNow/hydrator)
